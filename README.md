# Infinity

Infinity is a role-playing game for the Game Boy Color handheld game console, developed by Affinix Software primarily between the years 1999 and 2001. The game is incomplete and should be considered alpha/preview quality. See the [Affinix website](http://affinix.com) for the full announcement regarding the project release as well as a downloadable ROM file.

## Building

Currently the game only builds on a Windows host. Building the game requires GBDK, TASM, as well as custom build utilities that you'll need to compile.

From within the source tree, run `setup.bat` from a command prompt:

```
cd \path\to\infinity\bin
setup
```

This will create a virtual `J:` drive pointing to the root of the project and change to it.

Download [GBDK 2.1.5](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gbdk/files/gbdk/2.1.5/) (the .zip file that's in there) and unpack into the root of the project as the directory `sdk`.

Download and install [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Getting_Started) if you don't already have it. From a MinGW shell (leave the original command prompt alone, we'll come back to it), patch the GBDK and build the custom build utiltiies:

```sh
cd /j
patch -p0 < tools/gbdk_infinity.diff
cd tools/toolchain
make
```

You can close the MinGW shell now, we won't need it from here on.

Now from the command prompt, build the GBDK library using `make.bat`:

```
cd \sdk\gbz80-gb\2-1-5\lib
make.bat
```

Download [TASM 3.2](http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/250/25051.html). Unpack and save `tasm.exe` into the project's `bin` directory.

You should now have all the tools ready to build the game. Now go run a bunch of commands:

```
cd \resource\eve
itemconv --defs items.ref
copy itemdefs.h ..\..\source\eve
e
d
c
build
cd \resource\ext
build             (press Y at the prompt)
cd \
do
```

If all goes well, the game will be built as `build\j.gb`.

### Alternative Drive Letter

In some instances, your J: drive letter might already be in use.  If this is the case,  do the following, then replace all references to j in the above instructions with the drive letter you did end up using instead.

```
cd \path\to\infinity\bin
setup [DRIVE_LETTER_NOT_IN_USE]
```
